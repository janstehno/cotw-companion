### **Some history and staff**

The app was released on **27th of November 2020** on Android's Google Play. It offered few base info
about animals and that was it. During the year 2021 the app got a significantly more info, regarding
reserves, weapons, callers, and options for changing theme or language. The app also got maps with
hunting zones for each animal as well as locations of outposts and lookouts. Nowadays the app offers
features like need zones changing over time, catch book and trophy lodge to log your hunting
trophies, and newest addition, loadouts, offering you a way to see if you are able to shoot or lure
the animal. The app was also released for iOS users. The app still is and I hope will be in
development state so additional features will come eventually. I think the app is a good way to keep
the game's data by your side at any time (it works offline). You also do not have to remember
everything.

### **What about issues and features?**

I would like to appeal to everyone that not everything would be correct and mistakes can happen.
There is also an info that is missing. In these cases feel free to contact me about it through the
email or message me on discord or reddit provided in the app. Everything about planned features or
current issues can be found here.

### **What about updates?**

The updates usually take me **1 day** or even **3 weeks** to process. Do not forget that I am alone
and it will take time. Especially when there is a new map. I am always responding to huge amount of
reviews (that contain questions about the update) always the same way. It takes (literally
everytime) me a lot of time. So the update will **not** be the day after the game's one. But it will
come eventually.

### **I am confused by the interface. Is there any kind of a guide?**

I am planning on creating a little guide that could help users to understand what part of the app
does what. It will probably be stored here on GitHub so anyone can access it.

### **Thank you!**

For those who at least mentioned the app anywhere and especially for those who regularly use my app:
Thank you very much for your support and reviews you gave me. I appreciate it a lot. To this day,
the app was used at least once by almost **30K** users on Android and almost **20K** users on iOS.
Which is totally awesome and I did not think this could be possible. Without you I probably would
not be able to release the app for iOS devices.

### **Support Me**

You can support me through [PayPal](https://paypal.me./toastovac). It is the only way I use for now.
If anybody is interested in supporting me through something else, please, send me an email or
message me on discord or reddit. We can discuss other options than PayPal for sure. It will be
appreciated a lot. It also encourages me to update the app. Thank you everyone who already did or
will do.
