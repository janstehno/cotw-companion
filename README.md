# **COTW Companion**

`This application is a fan-made project. It is definitely not official and has no connection to the game developers whatsoever.`

Companion application for the game theHunterâ„¢ Call of the Wild. Application offers information about
huntable animals, usable weapons and callers and information about reserves you can hunt in.
Application also offers interactive maps and list of need zones changing over time, catch book,
loadouts, counters, and other useful features.

### **Newest version**

- [**android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toastyapps.cotwcompanion)
- [**ios**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cotw-companion/id6443782494)

### **History and staff**

The app was released on **27th of November 2020** on Android's Google Play. The app (1.4.6) was also
released for iOS users on **13th of October 2022**. It offered few base info about animals and that
was it. During the year 2021 the app got a significantly more info, regarding reserves, weapons,
callers, and options for changing theme or language. The app also got maps with hunting zones for
each animal as well as locations of outposts and lookouts. Nowadays the app offers features like
need zones changing over time, catch book and trophy lodge to log your hunting trophies, loadouts,
offering you a way to see if you are able to shoot or lure the animal, skill and perk planner, list
of missions, and counters to track your grind progress.

The app still is and I hope will be in development state so additional features will come
eventually. I think the app is a good way to keep the game's data by your side at any time (it works
offline). You also do not have to remember everything.

### **What about issues and features?**

I would like to appeal to everyone that not everything will be correct and mistakes can happen. If
you find anything wrong feel free to contact me about it through the email or message me on reddit
or discord provided in the app. Everything about issues can be found
[**here**](https://github.com/janstehno/cotw-companion/issues).
And you can share or view and upvote other's ideas of future app features
[**here**](https://github.com/janstehno/cotw-companion/discussions).

### **What about updates?**

The updates usually take me **1-3 days** or even **3 weeks** to process. Do not forget that I am
alone. New weapon pack or small updates will not take so long. However new map will. I have to
recreate whole map background. Find all outposts, lookouts and hides. Find all the information about
animals (trophy scores, weights, locations, need zones) as well as make screenshots of them and
create their heads for the app. Translate everything into 10 languages and make sure that everything
is as correct as it can be.

### **I am confused by the interface. Is there any kind of a guide?**

I am planning on creating a little guide that could help users to understand what part of the app
does what. It will probably be stored here on GitHub so anyone can access it.

### **Thank you!**

For those who at least mentioned the app anywhere and especially for those who regularly use my app:
Thank you very much for your support and reviews you gave me. I appreciate it a lot. To this day,
the app was used at least once by almost **50K** users on Android and almost **25K** users on iOS.
Which is totally awesome and I did not think this could be possible.

### **Support Me**

It will be appreciated a lot. It also encourages me to update the app. Thank you everyone who
already did or will do.
