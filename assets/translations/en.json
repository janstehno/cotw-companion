  "about_paragraph_1_1": "This app is made for fans of the game theHunterâ„¢ Call of the Wild. App offers info about species huntable in the game. There is also info about weapons and callers usable in the game for hunting.",
  "about_paragraph_1_2": "Interactive maps are in progress. Animal zones are only approximate and they do not really have to be same with your animal population on your single player maps. So count with it and take those zones just as sort of a guide.",
  "about_paragraph_1_3": "All game icons, maps, animal's heads and their anatomy are remade by myself. All is taken from the game as a screenshot and vectorized. All the info about species etc. is taken mostly from the game itself. More detailed information, like maximum trophy score or fur rarity, is taken from various spreadsheets or game guides on Steam. Feel free to contact me about misleading info.",
  "about_paragraph_1_4": "This is not an official app",
  "about_paragraph_2": "To be honest, this app took some pretty great amount of time to make. So if you really like it and you would like to support me, please consider donating. I am not forcing anybody to anything. It will be just your free choice. But if you even then choose to donate, it will be really, really appreciated. Thank you!",
  "about_paragraph_3": "My native language is Czech and translations to other languages except English are a bit challenging for me. Keep in mind, that not everything will be translated properly. I am still working on fur types translations. If you would like to help me with this, I would be very grateful. My email address can be found below.",
